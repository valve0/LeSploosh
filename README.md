In order to run this game properly please follow the instructions on boot up of the game. But it is repeated here:

> The game needs to be run in the Windows Console, not the Windows Terminal which is a newer version

  You know if you are using the terminal as it will have tabs.
  In order to change from the terminal to the console you need to go into the settings of the terminal and
  under 'Startup' change the 'Default terminal application to "Windows Console Host". Close and restart this program

> The font of the Console needs to be set to 16 (default).

  In order to change the font of the console, right click the top header and go to Properties -> Font -> Size.
