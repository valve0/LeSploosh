Modern games not fustrating enough?

Need a dose of nostalgia? Especially Sploosh kaboom from the Legend of Zelda Windwaker. Well...

Introducing....

![TitleCardText](https://github.com/valve0/LeSploosh/assets/10867487/f2112242-4c39-4b63-9fca-ec7c9fbfd27b)


## What is Le Sploosh?

Sploosh Kaboom is a minigame in The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker similar to the classic board game Battleship. In it, the player is presented with an empty board within which three squid groups of varying length are hidden.
The player can fire at a chosen grid location, which will then show whether a squid was hit there. A group is eliminated when all of its squids are hit. The object of the game is to eliminate all three groups within 24 shots.


The speed run destroying (and importantly) copyright ambiguous game that we all love to hate. Now in text based form. Who needs fancy graphics?
Based off Sploosh Kaboom or Sinking Ships (google either to see gameplay of the original)
